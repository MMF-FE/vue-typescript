# vue-typescript
> vue2.x that use typescript.

## Documentation

- [svgicon](https://github.com/MMF-FE/vue-svgicon): A tool to create svg icon components. (vue 2.x)
- [For Vue 2.0](http://vuejs.org/guide/): general information about how to work with Vue, not specific to this template

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init MMF-FE/vue-typescript my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

If port 8080 is already in use on your machine you must change the port number in `/config/index.js`. Otherwise `npm run dev` will fail.
Or you can do as follow:

```bash
PORT=3002 npm run dev
```

## What's Included
- `svgicon`

- `npm run dev`: first-in-class development experience.
  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.
  - State preserving hot-reload
  - State preserving compilation error overlay
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint

  - CSS across all components extracted into a single file and minified with [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano).

  - Use `npm run build --report`to build with bundle size analytics.
